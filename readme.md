This is the project repo for the JPMC Software Engineering Lite Program, consult the program instructions for more information.
According to the engineering tickets given. I created a new class RewardValue.
The two methods within it are getCashValue() and getMilesValue.
Task 2 required me to finish the Junit test methods convert_from_cash_to_miles and convert_from _miles_to_cash.
All codes were written with OOP and works perfectly.
