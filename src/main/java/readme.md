# :airplane: Credit Rewards Converter :airplane:

A Java class named RewardValue appears to represent a reward system that can convert between cash and airline miles based on a fixed conversion rate.
It includes constructors for initializing reward values and methods to retrieve the cash value or the miles value of a reward.

The purpose of this class is to encapsulate the logic for converting between cash and miles based on the provided conversion rate.
Clients can create RewardValue objects with either cash or miles values, and then retrieve the corresponding values using the getCashValue() and getMilesValue() methods.

The class allows users to work with either cash or mileage values and abstracts the conversion logic away from the users, 
making conversions easier to perform without having to remember the conversion formula.
